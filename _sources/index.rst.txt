Scikit-TDA is currently under construction. If you would like to contribute, please reach out to us on github_, twitter_ or on slack_.


This project aims to provide a curated library of TDA Python tools that are widely usable and easily approachable. 

It is structured so that each package can stand alone or be used as part of the scikit-tda bundle. 

Install
---------

Installation of all libraries can be done directly from Pypi in one command.

``pip install scikit-tda``

Issues & Contributions
