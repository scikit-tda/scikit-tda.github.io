Scikit-TDA is a home for Topological Data Analysis Python libraries intended for non-topologists. This project aims to provide a curated library of TDA Python tools that are widely usable and easily approachable. 

The structure of these libraries is inspired by the `Tidyverse <https://tidyverse.org>`_ in that each package can stand alone and can be installed individually but each adheres to the same design principles. Further, the most benefit comes from using all of them together. You'll notice that in many of the examples and notebooks, multiple libraries are used together. 

If you would like to contribute, please reach out to us on github_, twitter_ or on slack_.
