About
=======

This project is entirely a work in progress and still in the conceptual phase. 
We hope to assemble an ecosystem of TDA libraries that is approachable to people outside the field of Algebraic Topology, complete with documentation, notebooks, and examples to get you up to speed.  


Install
---------

Installation of all libraries can be done directly from Pypi in one command.

::

  pip install scikit-tda
