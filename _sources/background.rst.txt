What is Topological Data Analysis?
------------------------------------

Topological Data Analysis is a set of techniques for understanding and exploiting the topology of data. 
The goal is to uncover and make use of structures in the data that many other techniques are blind to. 
For instance, persistent homology will identify loops or holes in high dimensions that might indicate some unrealized time dependent behavior.
This information can inform downstream analysis in many different ways, deciding to use a radial basis function kernel. 
Alternatively, topological structures in data sets might not be directly interpretable, but still provide excellent signatures for discriminating between multiple different sets.
