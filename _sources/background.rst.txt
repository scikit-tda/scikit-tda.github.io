What is Topological Data Analysis?
------------------------------------

Topological Data Analysis is a set of techniques for understanding and exploiting the topology of data. 
The goal is to uncover and make use of structures in the data that many other techniques are blind to. 
For instance, persistent homology will identify loops or holes in high dimensions that might indicate some unrealized time dependent behavior.
This information can inform downstream analysis in many different ways.
Alternatively, topological structures in data sets might not be directly interpretable, but still provide excellent signatures for discriminating between multiple different sets.
In this context, the resulting persistence diagrams can be used as a feature in other machine learning models.

Another method from TDA is Mapper, which is designed to help you visualize and explore high dimensional data sets. Mapper will capture much of the critical topological structures as a graph which can be viewed in lower dimensions.
